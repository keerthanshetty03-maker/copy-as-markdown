# Privacy Policy – Copy as Markdown

Copy as Markdown does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.

All functionality runs locally in the user’s browser. The extension processes user-selected content only after a manual action and does not retain or transmit this information.

No third-party services, analytics, or tracking technologies are used.
